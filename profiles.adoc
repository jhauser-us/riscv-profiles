== Introduction

RISC-V was designed to provide a highly modular and extensible
instruction set, and includes a large and growing set of standard
extensions.  In addition, users may add their own custom
extensions. This flexibility can be used to highly optimize a
specialized design by including only the exact set of ISA features
required for an application, but the same flexibility also leads to a
combinatorial explosion in possible ISA choices.  Profiles specify a
much smaller common set of ISA choices that capture the most value for
most users, and which thereby enable the software community to focus
resources on building a rich software ecosystem.

NOTE: Another pragmatic concern is the long and unwieldy ISA strings
required to encode common sets of extensions, which will continue to
grow as new extensions are defined.

Each profile is built on a standard base ISA plus a set of mandatory
ISA extensions, and provides a small set of standard ISA options to
extend the mandatory components.  Profiles provide a convenient
shorthand for describing the ISA portions of hardware and software
platforms, and also guide the development of common software
toolchains shared by different platforms that use the same profile.
The intent is that the software ecosystem focus on supporting the
profiles' mandatory base and standard options, instead of attempting
to support every possible combination of individual extensions.
Similarly, hardware vendors should aim to structure their offerings
around standard profiles to increase the likelihood their designs will
have mainstream software support.

NOTE: Profiles are not intended to prohibit the use of combinations of
individual ISA extensions or the addition of custom extensions, which
can continue to be used for more specialized applications albeit
without the expectation of widespread software support.

As RISC-V evolves over time, the set of ISA features will grow, and
new platforms will be added that may need different profiles.  To
manage this evolution, RISC-V is adopting a model of regular annual
releases of new ISA profiles, following an ISA roadmap managed by the
RISC-V Technical Steering Committee.

The architecture profiles will also be used for branding and to
advertise compatibility with the RISC-V standard.

This document describes the general structure of RISC-V architecture
profiles and also the specifics of the first two families of
architecture profiles for application processors: RVA20 and RVA22.

NOTE: Other profiles are under development: RVI20 for basic RISC-V
unprivileged software compatibility, and RVM20 and RVM22 for
microcontroller platforms and these will be added in a future version
of this document.

== Profiles versus Platforms

Profiles only describe ISA features, not a complete execution
environment.

A _software_ _platform_ is a specification for an execution
environment, in which software targeted for that software platform can
run.

A _hardware_ _platform_ is a specification for a hardware system
(which can be viewed as a physical realization of an execution
environment).

Both software and hardware platforms include specifications for many
features beyond details of the ISA used by RISC-V harts in the
platform (e.g., boot process, calling convention, behavior of
environment calls, discovery mechanism, presence of certain
memory-mapped hardware devices, etc.).  Architecture profiles factor
out ISA-specific definitions from platform definitions to allow ISA
profiles to be reused across different platforms, and to be used by
tools (e.g., compilers) that are common across many different
platforms.

A platform can add additional constraints on top of those in a
profile.  For example, mandating an extension that is a standard
option in the underlying profile, or constraining some
implementation-specific parameter in the profile to lie within a
certain range.

A platform cannot remove constraints from a profile.

NOTE: A new profile should be proposed if existing profiles do not
match the needs of a new platform.

== Components of a Profile

=== Profile Family

Every profile is a member of a _profile_ _family_.  A profile family
is a set of profiles that are designed for the same applications and
that share the same base ISA but which vary in highest-supported
privilege mode.  The initial three types of family are:

- generic unprivileged instructions (I)
- microcontrollers for embedded systems (M)
- application processors running rich operating systems (A)

A profile family may be updated no more than annually, and the release
calendar year is treated as part of the profile family name.

More profile families may be added over time.

Each profile family is described in more detail below.

=== Profile Privilege Mode

RISC-V has a layered architecture supporting multiple privilege modes,
and most RISC-V platforms support more than one privilege mode.
Software is usually written assuming a particular privilege mode
during execution.  For example, application code is written assuming
it will be run in user mode, and kernel code is written assuming it
will be run in supervisor mode.

NOTE: Software can be run in a mode different than the one for which
it was written. For example, privileged code using privileged ISA
features can be run in a user-mode execution environment, but will
then cause traps into the enclosing execution environment when
privileged instructions are executed.  This behavior might be
exploited, for example, to emulate a privileged execution environment
using a user-mode execution environment.

In general, available instructions vary by privilege mode, and the
behavior of RISC-V instructions can depend on the current privilege
mode.  For this reason, there are separate profiles for each
privileged mode that a profile family supports.

A profile may specify that certain conditions will cause a requested
trap (such as an `ecall` made in the highest-supported privilege mode)
or fatal trap to the enclosing execution environment.

NOTE: A profile does not constrain how invisible traps to a more
privileged mode are used to emulate profile features.  In general, a
profile can be implemented by an execution environment using any
hardware or software technique that provides compatible functionality,
up to and including pure software emulation.

The profile for a privilege mode describes the ISA features for an
execution environment that has the eponymous privilege mode as the
most-privileged mode available, but also includes all supported
lower-privilege modes.  For example, an S-mode profile includes U-mode
as well as S-mode and describes the behavior of instructions when
running in different modes in an S-mode execution environment, such as
how an `ecall` instruction in U-mode causes a contained trap into an
S-mode handler whereas an `ecall` in S-mode causes a requested trap
out to the execution environment.

A more-privileged profile can always support running software to
implement a less-privileged profile from the same profile family.  For
example, a platform supporting the S-mode profile can run a
supervisor-mode operating system that provides user-mode execution
environments supporting the U-mode profile.

NOTE: Instructions in a U-mode profile, which are all executed in user
mode, have potentially different behaviors than instructions executed
in user mode in an S-mode profile.  For this reason, a U-mode profile
cannot be considered a subset of an S-mode profile.

=== Profile ISA Features

An architecture profile has a mandatory base instruction set (RV32I or
RV64I).

NOTE: RV32I and RV64I are the only currently ratified base ISAs.

In addition, the profile categorizes all ratified ISA extensions for
that base ISA into four categories:

. Mandatory
. Supported Optional
. Unsupported Optional
. Incompatible

As the name implies, _Mandatory_ _ISA_ _extensions_ are a required
part of the profile.  Implementations of the profile must provide
these.  The combination of the profile base ISA plus the mandatory ISA
extensions are termed the profile _mandates_, and software using the
profile can assume these always exist.

_Supported_ _Optional_ extensions (also known as _supported_
_options_), are those that are optional, but which are expected to be
generally supported by the software ecosystem for this profile.

NOTE: The level of "support" for Supported Optional extension will
likely vary greatly among different software components supporting a
profile, but at the bare minimum tools or runtimes that are claiming
compatibility with the profile must not report errors or warnings if
supported options are present.

Proper subsets of a supported option are not a supported option.

NOTE: The profile mandates and supported options describe the set of
ISA features the software ecosystem for that profile is expected to
support, as well as the granularity of that support.  Unless
explicitly listed as a supported option, individual extensions are not
expected to be supported.

_Unsupported_ _Optional_ _Extensions_ are those that are optional, but
which are not expected to be generally supported by the software
ecosystem.

NOTE: Software components claiming to support a profile are not
expected to be able to support these extensions, and may error or
report warnings if they are present.

_Incompatible_ _extensions_ are those that conflict with the base or
optional extensions.  Software can assume these extensions are not
present.

All components of a ratified profile must themselves have been
ratified.

NOTE: Extensions that are ratified after a given profile is released
are effectively either Unsupported Optional or Incompatible for that
profile.  A later release of a profile family may choose to
include the feature as Mandatory or Supported Optional.

Platforms may provide a discovery mechanism to determine what optional
extensions are present.

=== Profile Naming Convention

A profile name is a string comprised of, in order:

. prefix RV for RISC-V
. a specific profile family string (I, M, or A)
. a numeric string giving the first complete calendar year for which
the profile is ratified, represented as number of years after year
2000 (i.e., 20 for profiles built on specifications ratified during 2019)
. a privilege mode (U, S, M)
. a base ISA specifier (32, 64)

The initial profiles based on specifications ratified in 2019 are:

- RVI20U32 basic unprivileged instructions for RV32I
- RVI20U64 basic unprivileged instructions for RV64I
- RVM20U32, RVM20S32, RVM20M32 profiles for microcontrollers based on RV32I
- RVM20U64, RVM20S64, RVM20M64 profiles for microcontrollers based on RV64I
- RVA20U64, RVA20S64 64-bit application-processor profiles

NOTE: This document currently only includes the RVAx64 profiles, which
are the first to be defined.  The others will be added later.

== RVA20 Profiles

The RVA20 profiles are intended to be used for 64-bit application
processors running rich OS stacks.  Only user-mode (RVA20U64) and
supervisor-mode (RVA20S64) profiles are specified in this family.

NOTE: There is no machine-mode profile defined.  A machine-mode profile
for application processors would only be used in specifying platforms
for portable machine-mode software. Given the relatively low volume of
portable M-mode software, the wide variety of potential M-mode code,
and the very specific needs of each type of M-mode software, we assume
each portable M-mode software ecosystem would specify individual ISA
requirements as part of their M-mode platform specification.

NOTE: Only 64-bit application processor profiles are currently
defined.  It would be possible to also define very similar 32-bit
variants.

=== RVA20U64 Profile

The RVA20U64 profile specifies the ISA features available to user-mode
execution environments in 64-bit applications processors.  This is the
most important profile within the application processor family in
terms of the amount of software that targets this profile.

RVA20U64 has no supported options.

==== RVA20U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA20U64.

==== RVA20U64 Mandatory Extensions

- *M* Integer multiplication and divison.
- *A* Atomic instructions.
- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.
- *C* Compressed Instructions.
- *Zicsr*  CSR instructions.  These are implied by presence of F.
- *Zicntr* Base counters and timers.
- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.
- Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must
  support instruction fetch, AMOArithmetic, and RsrvEventual.
- Reservation sets must be contiguous and at least 16 bytes and at most 128 bytes in size.
- Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the
  cacheability and coherence PMAs must be supported.

NOTE: Even when supported, misaligned loads and stores might execute
extremely slowly.  Standard software distributions should assume their
existence only for correctness, not for performance.

==== RVA20U64 Supported Optional Extensions

None.

==== RVA20U64 Unsupported Optional Extensions

- *Q* Quad-precision floating-point instructions.

NOTE: Quad-precision floating-point is unlikely to be implemented in
hardware.

- *Zifencei* Instruction-fetch fence instruction.

NOTE: Zifencei is not classed as supported optional in the user-mode
profile because it is not sufficient by itself to produce the desired
effect in a multiprogrammed multiprocessor environment without OS
support, and so the instruction cache flush should always be performed
using an OS call rather than using the `fence.i` instruction.  `fence.i`
semantics can be expensive to implement for some hardware memory
hierarchy designs, and so alternative non-standard instruction-cache
coherence mechanisms can be used behind the OS abstraction.  A
separate extension is being developed for more general and efficient
instruction cache coherence.

NOTE: The execution environment must provide a means to synchronize writes to
instruction memory with instruction fetches, the implementation of which
likely relies on the Zifencei extension.
For example, RISC-V Linux supplies the `__riscv_flush_icache` system call and
a corresponding vDSO call.

==== RVA20U64 Incompatible Extensions

None.

NOTE: The RVA20 specification only categorizes extensions ratified in
2019.

==== RVA20U64 Recommendations

Recommendations are not strictly mandated but are included to guide
implementers making design choices.

Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.

=== RVA20S64 Profile

The RVA20S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVA20S64 is based on privileged architecture version
1.11.

RVA20S64 has only one supported option (Sv48).

==== RVA20S64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA20S64.

==== RVA20S64 Mandatory Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are mandatory:

- The RVA20S64 mandatory base includes all the mandatory unprivileged
instructions in RVA20U64, except that `ecall` in user mode causes a
contained trap to supervisor mode.

- *Zifencei*  Instruction-Fetch Fence.

NOTE: Zifencei is mandated as it is the only standard way to support
instruction-cache coherence in RVA20 application processors.  A new
instruction-cache coherence mechanism is under development which might
be added as an option in the future.

The following privileged extensions are mandatory:

- *Ss1p11*  Privileged Architecture version 1.11.

- *Sv39* Page-Based 39-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- In addition to Sv39, the `satp` mode Bare must be supported.

- Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must
  support hardware page-table reads.
  Such regions must additionally support hardware page-table writes if
  any harts support hardware page-table writes.

- `stvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).  When
  `stvec.MODE=Direct`, `stvec.BASE` must be capable of holding any
  valid four-byte-aligned address.

- `stval` must be written with the faulting virtual address for load,
  store, and instruction page-fault, access-fault, and misaligned
  exceptions, and for breakpoint exceptions other than those caused by
  execution of the `ebreak` or `c.ebreak` instructions.  For
  illegal-instruction exceptions, `stval` must be written with the
  faulting instruction.

- For any `hpmcounter` that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit
  in `scounteren` must be writable.

==== RVA20S64 Supported Optional Extensions

RVA20S64 has no unprivileged optional extensions.

The following are privileged optional extensions:

- *Sv48* Page-Based 48-bit Virtual-Memory System.

NOTE: There may be additional options and parameters in the privileged
architecture that should be detailed here.

==== RVA20S64 Unsupported Optional Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are unsupported:

- *Q*  Quad-Precision Floating-Point.

- *N* User-Level Interrupts.

NOTE: The unprivileged N extension for user-level interrupts has _not_
been ratified, but the ratified privileged architecture v1.11 text
refers to user-level interrupts.

The following privileged extensions are unsupported:

- *sstatus.UXL!=64*  Different User-Mode XLEN.

NOTE: This extension is not expected to be widely used.
Applications that want to use 32-bit pointers to reduce memory footprint
should use a forthcoming RV64 ILP32 ABI instead.

- *stvec.MODE=Vectored*  Hardware Trap Vectoring.

NOTE: Hardware vectoring of exception/interrupt traps is not generally
used by rich operating systems.

==== RVA20S64 Incompatible Extensions

There are no incompatible unprivileged extensions.

The following are incompatible privileged extensions:

- *IALIGN!=16* Masking of `sepc[1]` bit.

NOTE: Increasing IALIGN to 32 by disabling compressed instructions is
incompatible as the RVA20S64 profile mandates compressed instruction
support.  Systems supporting dynamic switching must turn on compressed
instruction support (e.g., by setting the `misa.c` bit) before
creating a supervisor-mode execution environment following the
RVA20S64 profile.






== RVA22 Profiles

The RVA22 profiles are intended to be used for 64-bit application
processors running rich OS stacks.  Only user-mode (RVA22U64) and
supervisor-mode (RVA22S64) profiles are specified in this family.

NOTE: Normally, a calendar spec release would only include a single
year of profiles.  For this initial proposal, both RVA20 and RVA22 are
shown together to help explain the lifecycle of the profiles.

=== RVA22U64 Profile

The RVA22U64 profile specifies the ISA features available to user-mode
execution environments in 64-bit applications processors.  This is the
most important profile within the application processor family in
terms of the amount of software that targets this profile.

RVA22U64 has 4 supported options (Zfh, V, Zkn, Zks).

==== RVA22U64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA22U64.

==== RVA22U64 Mandatory Extensions

The following mandatory extensions were present in RVA20U64.

- *M* Integer multiplication and divison.
- *A* Atomic instructions.
- *F* Single-precision floating-point instructions.
- *D* Double-precision floating-point instructions.
- *C* Compressed Instructions.
- *Zicsr*  CSR instructions.  These are implied by presence of F.
- *Zicntr* Base counters and timers.
- *Zihpm* Hardware performance counters.
- Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must
  support instruction fetch, AMOArithmetic, and RsrvEventual.
- Misaligned loads and stores to main memory regions with both the
  cacheability and coherence PMAs must be supported.

NOTE: Even when supported, misaligned loads and stores might execute
extremely slowly.  Standard software distributions should assume their
existence only for correctness, not for performance.

The following mandatory feature was further restricted in RVA22U64:

- Reservation sets are a maximum of 64 bytes, and must be naturally aligned to a power-of-2 byte-address boundary.

NOTE: The maximum reservation size has been reduced to match the
required cache line size.  The minimum reservation size is effectively
set by the instructions in the mandatory A extension.

The following mandatory extensions are new for RVA22U64.

- *Zihintpause* Pause instruction.

NOTE: While the `pause` instruction is a HINT can be implemented as a
NOP and hence trivially supported by hardware implementers, it's
inclusion in the mandatory extension list signifies that software
should use the instruction whenever it would make sense and that
implementors are expected to exploit this information to optimize
hardware execution.

- *Zba* Address computation.
- *Zbb* Basic bit manipulation.
- *Zbs* Single-bit instructions.

Cache blocks must be 64 bytes in size, naturally aligned in the
address space.

NOTE: While the general RISC-V specifications are agnostic to cache
block size, selecting a common cache line size simplifies the
specification and use of the following cache-block extensions within
the application processor profile. Software does not have to query a
discovery mechanism and/or provide dynamic dispatch to the appropriate
code. The choice of 64 bytes is effectively an industry
standard. Implementations may use longer cache lines with
per-64-byte-sub-block metadata to reduce tag cost while remaining
compatible. Implementations with shorter cache lines can sequence
operations on multiple cache lines to remain compatible.

- *Zicbom* Cache-Block Management Operations.
- *Zicbop* Cache-Block Prefetch Operations.

NOTE: As with other HINTS, the inclusion of prefetches in the
mandatory set of extensions indicates that software should generate
these instructions where they are expected to be useful, and hardware
is expected to exploit that information.

- *Zicboz* Cache-Block Zero Operations.

- *Zfhmin* Half-Precision Floating-point transfer and convert.

NOTE: Zfhmin is a small extension that adds support to load/store and
convert IEEE FP16 numbers to and from IEEE FP32 format.  The hardware
cost for this extension is low, and mandating the extension avoids
adding an option to the profile.

- *Zkt* Data-independent execution time.

NOTE: Zkt requires a certain subset of integer instructions execute
with data-independent latency.  Mandating this feature enables
portable libraries for safe basic cryptographic operations. It is
expected that application processors will naturally have this property
and so implementation cost is low, if not zero, in most systems that
would support RVA22.

==== RVA22U64 Supported Optional Extensions

The following optional extensions are new for RVA22U64.

- *Zfh* Half-Precision Floating-Point.

NOTE: A future profile might mandate Zfh.

- *V* Vector Extension.

NOTE: A future profile might mandate V.

- *Zkn* Scalar Crypto NIST Algorithms.
- *Zks* Scalar Crypto ShangMi Algorithms.

NOTE: The scalar crypto extensions are expected to be superceded by
vector crypto standards in future profiles, and the scalar extensions
may move to "unsupported optional" category once the vector crypto is
present.

==== RVA22U64 Unsupported Optional Extensions

The following unsupported optional extensions were present in RVA20U64:

- *Q* Quad-precision floating-point instructions.

NOTE: Quad-precision floating-point is unlikely to be implemented in
hardware.

- *Zifencei* Instruction-fetch fence instruction.

NOTE: Zifencei is not classed as supported optional in the user-mode
profile because it is not sufficient by itself to produce the desired
effect in a multiprogrammed multiprocessor environment without OS
support, and so the instruction cache flush should always be performed
using an OS call rather than using the `fence.i` instruction.  `fence.i`
semantics can be expensive to implement for some hardware memory
hierarchy designs, and so alternative non-standard instruction-cache
coherence mechanisms can be used behind the OS abstraction.  A
separate extension is being developed for more general and efficient
instruction cache coherence.

NOTE: The execution environment must provide a means to synchronize writes to
instruction memory with instruction fetches, the implementation of which
likely relies on the Zifencei extension.
For example, RISC-V Linux supplies the `__riscv_flush_icache` system call and
a corresponding vDSO call.

The following unsupported optional extensions were added in RVA22U64:

- *Zbc* Carryless multiply

NOTE: The remaining carryless multiply instructions that are not
included in the supported scalar crypto options are not considered
sufficiently important to make a support option in the profile.
Possibly the remaining instructions could be merged into the supported
option.

- *Zbkb*, *Zbkc*, *Zbkx*, *Zknd*, *Zkne*, *Zknh*, *Zksed*, *Zksh*  Scalar crypto subset extensions.

NOTE: The smaller extensions are not considered important to provide
as supported options.  Profile implementers must provide all of the
instructions in a given algorithm suite.

- *Zve32f*, *Zve32x*, *Zve64d*, *Zve64f*, *Zve64x* Vector subset extensions.

NOTE: The smaller vector extensions are not considered important to
provide as supported options in the profile. The V extension is
specified as the supported option for application processors.

- *Zkr* Entropy CSR

NOTE: Access to the entropy source in a system is usually carefully
controlled.  While the design supports unprivileged access to the
entropy source, this is unlikely to be often used.

==== RVA22U64 Incompatible Extensions

There were no incompatible extensions in RVA20U64.

The following incompatible extensions were added for RVA22U64.

- *Zfinx*, *Zdinx*, *Zhinx*, *Zhinxmin* Floating-point in X registers.

NOTE: These are incompatible with the profile mandates to support the
F and D extensions.

==== RVA22U64 Recommendations

Recommendations are not strictly mandated but are included to guide
implementers making design choices.

Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
exceptions on attempts to execute unimplemented opcodes.

=== RVA22S64 Profile

The RVA22S64 profile specifies the ISA features available to a
supervisor-mode execution environment in 64-bit applications
processors.  RVA22S64 is based on privileged architecture version
1.12.

RVA22S64 has four unprivileged supported options (Zfh, V, Zkn, Zks)
and six privileged supported options (Sv48, Sv57, Sstc, Sscofpmf, Zkr, H).

==== RVA22S64 Mandatory Base

RV64I is the mandatory base ISA for RVA22S64.

==== RVA22S64 Mandatory Extensions

The following unprivileged extensions are mandatory:

- The RVA22S64 mandatory base includes all the mandatory unprivileged
instructions in RVA22U64, except that `ecall` in user mode causes a
contained trap to supervisor mode.

- *Zifencei*  Instruction-Fetch Fence.

NOTE: Zifencei is mandated as it is the only standard way to support
instruction-cache coherence in RVA22 application processors.  A new
instruction-cache coherence mechanism is under development which might
be added as an option in the future.

The following privileged extensions are mandatory:

- *Ss1p12*  Privileged Architecture version 1.12.

- *Sv39* Page-Based 39-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- In addition to Sv39, the `satp` mode Bare must be supported.

- Main memory regions with both the cacheability and coherence PMAs must
  support hardware page-table reads.
  Such regions must additionally support hardware page-table writes if
  any harts support hardware page-table writes.

- stvec.MODE must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).
  When stvec.MODE=Direct,
  stvec.BASE must be capable of holding any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- stval must be written with the faulting virtual address for load, store, and
  instruction page-fault, access-fault, and misaligned exceptions, and for
  breakpoint exceptions other than those caused by execution of the EBREAK or
  C.EBREAK instructions.
  For illegal-instruction exceptions, stval must be written with the faulting
  instruction.

- For any hpmcounter that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit
  in scounteren must be writable.

- sstatus.UBE must not be read-only 1.

- *Svpbmt* Page-Based Memory Types

- *Svnapot* NAPOT Translation Contiguity

- *Svinval* Fine-Grained Address-Translation Cache Invalidation

==== RVA22S64 Supported Optional Extensions

All RVA22U64 supported optional extensions (Zfh, V, Zkn, Zks).

The privileged optional extensions are:

- *Sv48* Page-Based 48-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Sv57* Page-Based 57-bit Virtual-Memory System.

- *Sstc* supervisor-mode timer interrupts

NOTE: Sstc was not made mandatory in RVA22S64 as it is a more
disruptive change affecting system-level architecture, and will take
longer for implementations to adopt.  It is expected to be made
mandatory in the next profile release.

- *Sscofpmf* Count Overflow and Mode-Based Filtering

NOTE: Platforms may choose to mandate the presence of Sscofpmf.

- *Zkr*  Entropy CSR

- *H* The hypervisor extension.

When the hypervisor extension is implemented, the following are also mandatory:

- *Smstateen* State-enable extension.  The supervisor-mode
   (`sstateen0-3`) and hypervisor-mode (`hstateen0-3`) state-enable
   registers must be provided.

NOTE: The extension specification is named as an M-mode extension as
it includes M-mode features, but also has supervisor-mode components.
Only the supervisor/hypervisor-mode-visible components are mandated in
the RVA22S64 profile.  These registers are not mandated or
supported-optional without the hypervisor extension, as otherwise
there are no RVA22S64 supported options with relevant state to
control.

- For any `hpmcounter` that is not read-only zero, the corresponding bit
  in `hcounteren` must be writable.

- `vstval` must be written in all cases described above for `stval`.

- `htval` must be written with the faulting guest physical address in all
  circumstances permitted by the ISA.

- `vstvec.MODE` must be capable of holding the value 0 (Direct).
  When `vstvec.MODE`=Direct,
  `vstvec.BASE` must be capable of holding any valid four-byte-aligned address.

- All translation modes supported in `satp` must be supported in `vsatp`.

- For each supported virtual memory scheme SvNN supported in `satp`, the
  corresponding hgatp SvNNx4 mode must be supported.  The `hgatp` mode Bare
  must also be supported.

==== RVA22S64 Unsupported Optional Extensions

Unprivileged unsupported optional extensions are:

- RVA22S64 has the same unsupported optional extensions as RVA22U64 except for Zkr.

The following privileged extensions are unsupported:

- *sstatus.UXL!=64*  Different User-Mode XLEN.

NOTE: This extension is not expected to be widely used.

- *stvec.MODE=Vectored*  Hardware Trap Vectoring.

NOTE: Hardware vectoring of exception/interrupt traps is not generally
used by rich operating systems.

==== RVA22S64 Incompatible Extensions

Incompatible unprivileged extensions are:

- All RVA22U64 incompatible extensions

The following are incompatible privileged extensions:

- *IALIGN!=16* Masking of `sepc[1]` bit.

NOTE: Increasing IALIGN to 32 by disabling compressed instructions is
incompatible as the RVA20S64 profile mandates compressed instruction
support.  Systems supporting dynamic switching must turn on compressed
instruction support (e.g., by setting the `misa.c` bit) before
creating a supervisor-mode execution environment following the
RVA20S64 profile.

==== RVA22S64 Recommendations

- Implementations are strongly recommended to raise illegal-instruction
  exceptions when attempting to execute unimplemented opcodes.
